I\u2019ve been in the US for three years. I came with my whole family\u2014my dad wanted us to have education here. It\u2019s been easy in a certain way, but sometimes I discover certain realities, how racism is a really big thing in this country. I walk on the street and I look like an African American, not an actual African. One time I was just walking on the street and I got handcuffed by police. I was just going to the bakery to buy some cakes. I was actually eating my cake on the street and I saw the police officers parking their cars and I even saw helicopters and those lights, and they parked their car next to me and handcuffed me. They started asking me questions, whether I was fighting or not. I told them I went out to buy a cake. Then I heard on their radio one of his co-workers saying that the person who was in the fight was not a black person so they let me go. It was the craziest experience I ever had. Being American only means opportunities. It doesn\u2019t mean being at the top of the world or being great, it just means having the opportunity to do something great. You come here, you get educated, you don\u2019t forget about your culture and where you\u2019re from, you know your goals, and you should try to make other parts of the world and even here a better place. I think what\u2019s happening right now is very sad. People don't leave their country because they want to leave their country; many people leave their country because they are in trouble. We are in the same world and should be looking for the good of all people, not only our people. I always hated that word, \u201cundocumented.\u201d They should not be considered \u201cundocumented,\u201d they should just be considered as people because we all live in the same world, we all live on earth. Earth belongs to all of us. \n#photooftheday\u00a0#photos\u00a0#picoftheday\u00a0#picture\u00a0#portrait\u00a0#beautiful\u00a0#human\u00a0#Americans\u00a0#America\u00a0#USA\u00a0#UnitedStates\u00a0#united\u00a0#tolerance\u00a0#stories\u00a0#children\u00a0#instagood\u00a0#instadaily\u00a0#photography\u00a0#beauty\u00a0#nofilter\u00a0#love\u00a0#colorful\u00a0#snapshot\u00a0#immigration\u00a0#immigrants\u00a0#dialogue\u00a0#creative\u00a0#capture\u00a0#art\u00a0#moment", "comments": {"count": 0}, "likes": {"count": 7}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516756396581265082", "dimensions": {"height": 1080, "width": 1080}, "owner": {"id": "4884824572"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/18512543_1870431673245532_990278540580618240_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMmegVBx66", "date": 1495031474, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18512543_1870431673245532_990278540580618240_n.jpg", "caption": "https://turningfireinto.blogspot.it/2017/05/reunion-rimini-2017.html #vtwin comparison #vroad vs #sportsterevo #masteroftorque  #torque #torquemonster \n#harleydavidson A VERY BIG REUNION IN #RIMINI! #SUN #BEACH AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT #BIKES ! #DO YOU LIKE #WALLOFDEATH #NOT ONLY #AMERICANS THERE, BUT ALSO #ITALIANS AND #JAPANESE #MOTORCYCLE  #MOTOBLOG #MOTOCICLISMO #RIDERS #CUSTOM #CUSTOMBIKES #MADEINUSA #MADEINJAPAN #LUXURYBIKES #LUXURY #MASTERCLASS #KUSTOM", "comments": {"count": 0}, "likes": {"count": 5}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516751671413501993", "dimensions": {"height": 941, "width": 1080}, "owner": {"id": "4379168667"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/c69.0.941.941/18444178_1370586216364790_6100514359748853760_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMlZvrFPAp", "date": 1495030910, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18444178_1370586216364790_6100514359748853760_n.jpg", "caption": "Texas Is Getting Hot And Humid Again #corvette #chevorlet #zr1 #america #american #americans #americanmuscle #muscle #musclecar #detroit #michigan #car #cars #carporn", "comments": {"count": 1}, "likes": {"count": 12}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516749433005274055", "dimensions": {"height": 750, "width": 750}, "owner": {"id": "2210917547"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/18513820_125389258026489_1611072671162826752_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMk5K_jfPH", "date": 1495030644, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s750x750/sh0.08/e35/18513820_125389258026489_1611072671162826752_n.jpg", "caption": "THE QUESTION OF THE DAY? \n#WAKEUP #INDIGENOUS #ABORIGINAL #LESSONS #STUDIES #LIBRARY #EXPOSETRUTH #thingsthatmakeyougohmmm \n#THIRDEYEOPEN \n#THINK #MOUNDBUILDERS\n#OLMECS #MUURS #AMERICANS #amuuricans", "comments": {"count": 1}, "likes": {"count": 12}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516747609975722826", "dimensions": {"height": 567, "width": 480}, "owner": {"id": "902993280"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.58.639.639/18580155_322192181544942_8100452356279238656_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMkepKhpNK", "date": 1495030426, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/p480x480/18580155_322192181544942_8100452356279238656_n.jpg", "caption": "5.25 am, September 5, 1986: The Pan Am 73 flight from Mumbai to Frankfurt landed at the Jinnah International Airport, Karachi, for an hour-long stopover.\n\nFour heavily-armed Palestinian men, belonging to the Abu Nidal Organisation, hijacked the #aircraft carrying 360 passengers, many of them Americans.\n\nThey grabbed Neerja, who was at the entrance to welcome the passengers, by her hair. Sensing danger, she conveyed the \u201chijack code\u201d over the intercom to the flight\u2019s cockpit crew. Soon, the cockpit crew \u2014 pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer \u2014 escaped through the cockpit\u2019s #emergency hatch. Being the purser, Neerja became the head of the flight even though she had started flying only six months ago.\n\nFor 17 hours, Neerja and other members of the crew did their best to take care of the passengers and calm them down. She protected the #Americans on board, who were targeted by the hijackers, by hiding their passports under a seat. At 9.55 pm, when the flight\u2019s auxiliary power unit ran out of fuel, plunging the aircraft into darkness, the #hijackers went on a shooting spree. Neerja and a passenger flung open two emergency doors, allowing many passengers to escape. While helping three children slide down the chute of the emergency exit, Neerja was hit by bullets. She was one of 23 casualties. Though she was rescued by two of her colleagues, she died before any medical assistance could reach her.

landed at the Jinnah International Airport, Karachi, for an hour-long stopover.\n\nFour heavily-armed Palestinian men, belonging to the Abu Nidal Organisation, hijacked the #aircraft carrying 360 passengers, many of them Americans.\n\nThey grabbed Neerja, who was at the entrance to welcome the passengers, by her hair. Sensing danger, she conveyed the \u201chijack code\u201d over the intercom to the flight\u2019s cockpit crew. Soon, the cockpit crew \u2014 pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer \u2014 escaped through the cockpit\u2019s #emergency hatch. Being the purser, Neerja became the head of the flight even though she had started flying only six months ago.\n\nFor 17 hours, Neerja and other members of the crew did their best to take care of the passengers and calm them down. She protected the #Americans on board, who were targeted by the hijackers, by hiding their passports under a seat. At 9.55 pm, when the flight\u2019s auxiliary power unit ran out of fuel, plunging the aircraft into darkness, the #hijackers went on a shooting spree. Neerja and a passenger flung open two emergency doors, allowing many passengers to escape. While helping three children slide down the chute of the emergency exit, Neerja was hit by bullets. She was one of 23 casualties. Though she was rescued by two of her colleagues, she died before any medical assistance could reach her.

Ouza will be able to travel, live and work in diverse sites all over the world, while providing legal services to the U.S. Air Force and defending the legal rights of U.S. airmen.\nDespite misconceptions, Ouza said her hijab wouldn\u2019t limit her and is actually one of the reasons she applied.\n\u201cThe #AirForce is all about leading a life of structure and immense discipline and, quite frankly, so is the #hijab ,\u201d she said. \u201cMy hijab is an asset to the Air Force, not a liability.\u201d\nGrowing up, she had found interest in serving the public, especially her community and country, and so her father and brothers encouraged her to join the Air Force.

The WHO labeled pesticides imbedded in most GMOs cancerous. Don't worry America's too hijacked to even notice.\n\nRoundup contains an active ingredient called glyphosate which the World Health Organization\u2019s #cancer arm famously classified as a possible carcinogen recently.\n\nRussia is banning any GMOs in its entire food production. \u201cAs far as genetically-modified organisms are concerned, we have made decision not to use any #GMO in #food productions,\u201d #Russia\u2019s Deputy PM Arkady Dvorkovich announced at an international conference on biotechnology.\n.\n\u201cIf the #Americans like to eat GMO products, let them eat it then. We don\u2019t need to do that; we have enough space and opportunities to produce #organic food,\u201d said Medvedev.\n.\nThe percentage of GMOs currently present in the Russian food industry is at a mere 0.01 percent, RT news reported. Russia\u2019s latest move comes after similar news pouring in from Western Europe in recent weeks.\n.\nFrance followed in the footsteps of other European Union countries\u2014#Scotland, #NorthIreland, #Germany, #Latvia and #Greece\u2014and has chosen the \u201copt-out\u201d of a #EU rule passed in March that allows its 28-member bloc to abstain from growing GMO crops, even if they are already authorized to be grown within the union.\n\nFrance\u2019s latest GMO-sweep also singles out Monsanto\u2019s MON 810 maize, the only GMO crop grown in #Europe. France, which is the EU\u2019s largest grain grower and exporter, is further cementing its anti-GMO sentiments with this latest move. The country already prohibits the cultivation of any variety of genetically modified maize due to environmental concerns.\n\nMonsanto, which maintains the safety of their products, has said it will abide by the requests from the growing wave of European countries turning their backs on these controversial crops. \nSales of Monsanto's deadly herbicide, which is contained in 750 products stooped last December in Europe.\n.\nTell @homedepot \u0026 @loweshomeimprovement to discontinue selling a known poison!
