With this ever growing problem it is key to learn what a bedbug is, where they hide and how to get ride of them and keep them gone for good.\n\nThey are elusive, nocturnal creatures. They can hide behind baseboards and in cracks, crevices and folded areas of beds, bedding and adjacent furniture, especially mattresses and box springs.\n\nTo give an example of what to look for, this photo is of a mother bedbug that has nested and laid eggs inside the screw hole of a wooden bed frame. Although wood isn't the only place they like to hide, wood knots, cracks and holes like these provide excellent harbourage spots for them to mate and lay eggs. Since bedbugs are only about the width of a credit card, they can squeeze into really small hiding spots. \nBedbug control is complicated and lengthy, often needing multiple visits. This is definitely not a do-it-yourself project. If you leave one bed bug, the problem will not go away. To schedule a bedbug inspection by a Certified Pest Control Specialist, please call our office or book an appointment through our website.\n\n#bedbugs #certifiedpestcontrol #prevention #awareness", "comments": {"count": 0}, "likes": {"count": 0}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516750419622342643", "dimensions": {"height": 1131, "width": 1080}, "owner": {"id": "990677612"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/c0.25.1080.1080/18444802_1671709232844636_3565470691367059456_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMlHh2g6_z", "date": 1495030761, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18444802_1671709232844636_3565470691367059456_n.jpg", "caption": "Puts a smile on my face every time. \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf31 #plantpower #prevention #wholefood", "comments": {"count": 0}, "likes": {"count": 1}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516749789177808466", "dimensions": {"height": 938, "width": 750}, "owner": {"id": "1691036879"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/c0.109.873.873/18444198_1806573206326557_1181661402822082560_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMk-WtF4ZS", "date": 1495030686, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p750x750/18444198_1806573206326557_1181661402822082560_n.jpg", "caption": "#prevention #mental health", "comments": {"count": 0}, "likes": {"count": 0}}], "count": 277332, "page_info": {"has_next_page": true, "end_cursor": "J0HWRxiDAAAAF0HWRxbngAAAFiYA"}}, "top_posts": {"nodes": [{"id": "1516736367722635531", "dimensions": {"height": 1080, "width": 1080}, "owner": {"id": "2185617271"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/18445084_1849414685320579_2324376321376911360_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMh7DABiEL", "date": 1495029086, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18445084_1849414685320579_2324376321376911360_n.jpg", "caption": "Study hard and become a good doctor\n\n#doctor #medicine #medical #health #medschool #medstudent #healthcare #anatomy #world #international #article #nurse #futuredoctor #healthyliving #creative #pharmacist #innovation #wellness #scientist #study #prevention #treatment #university #doctors #healthy #lifestyle", "comments": {"count": 46}, "likes": {"count": 4600}}, {"id": "1516267453318370845", "dimensions": {"height": 800, "width": 640}, "owner": {"id": "396129033"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e15/c0.80.640.640/18513828_333900230359986_6593501421927137280_n.jpg", "is_video": true, "code": "BUK3TcbhxYd", "date": 1494973187, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e15/18513828_333900230359986_6593501421927137280_n.jpg", "video_views": 5446, "caption": "\"Proper progression is mastery of one level of development before proceeding to the next\" -Gray Cook #Repost @akchristian\n\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\nI've had a super sticky shoulder lately and a few other nicks and nags.

Does this first movement demonstrated aggravate it? Are there modifications available?\n.\nRegardless of how you describe this movement (cat camel, cat cow, angry cat, you name it..) here is a modification if you\u2019re having neck pain! Excessive cervical flexion and/or extension repeatedly performed could be the reason for your neck pain. This is especially true for any new yogis out there because their body may not be use to moving through their extreme ranges of motion so often.\n.\nDemonstrated here is a modification to stabilizing the head and neck during this yoga movement. Instead of moving through full upper and lower cervical spine range of motion, you are now going to move the rest of your body on a stabilized head and neck. This is also a great way to work on neck strength and body awareness!\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3Find your neutral spine - look all the way up and all the way down and then hold a position in the middle. \n2\ufe0f\u20e3Keep your eyes focused straight ahead - the best cue for head and neck positioning is where you want the eyes to focus.\n3\ufe0f\u20e3Focus on moving through your thoracic spine and pelvis while best trying to stabilize your head and neck!\n.\nTry it out, let us know what you think. More importantly for any new yogis out there, it is OK to modify YOUR movement in any yoga class regardless of what people tell you. Do yoga smarter with [P]rehab. #yoga #catcamel #catcow #angrycat\n______________________________________________\nThe Prehab Guys: Optimizing human movement and performance, promoting longevity, and keeping your movement system in tune one post at a time.
