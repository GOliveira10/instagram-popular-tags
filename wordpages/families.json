Many #children struggle with postural stability during #mealtimes, which negatively impacts their ability to attend to the task of #eating, process the #sensoryinput, #selffeed and get their mouth to work correctly to chew up and swallow foods. \nEven if postural stability isn't a challenge for the child in other areas of their life, most seating arrangements #families use during mealtimes do not set children up for success. During mealtimes at home, most children are seated in #highchairs, #boosterseats, #sassyseats (pictured here) or adult sized #chairs that provide them with no foot support (a very important part of your base of support). When you have no foot support it is incredibly challenging to maintain a still seated posture-this is why so many #kids fidget in their chairs all throughout the mealtime! \nTypically, our first recommendations to families is to get their child in a stable seating arrangement to decrease the amount of brainpower and energy they have to put into keeping themselves upright in the chair during mealtimes. This frees them up to focus on the complex task of feeding themselves and eating.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to start providing additional support to a child during mealtimes is to give them a footrest. You can do this by purchasing them a new chair (I.e. Adjustable wooden chair) or simply modifying their current seating arrangement by fashioning a foot rest out of materials you have around the house- laundry hampers turned upside down, step stools, or old phone books or text books wrapped in duct tape (pictured here)! #pickyeater #pickyeaters #feedingtherapy #toddlermeals #momlife #dadlife #toddlermealtime #blw #familymeal #therapylife #tubefed #gtube", "comments": {"count": 0}, "likes": {"count": 3}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516758742615914188", "dimensions": {"height": 640, "width": 640}, "owner": {"id": "3580913322"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18580684_665774943611822_2494376852143996928_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMnApPlvbM", "date": 1495031753, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18580684_665774943611822_2494376852143996928_n.jpg", "caption": "Discover yoga... www.yogabodies.ca #yogabodiesvaughan #influencer #communityInfluencer\n#business #brands #Vaughan #families #localevents #clickinmoms #Maple #Kleinburg #Woodbridge #Thornhill #CityofVaughan #moms #kids #shoplocal #ExperienceVaughan #Ontario #kidsinvaughan #momsofinstagram  #vaughan #yorkregion #richmondhill #vaughanmills #meditation", "comments": {"count": 0}, "likes": {"count": 3}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516758454608848793", "dimensions": {"height": 640, "width": 640}, "owner": {"id": "3445838684"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/e15/18514228_1866356270294794_3081850854077104128_n.jpg", "is_video": true, "code": "BUMm8dBB-eZ", "date": 1495031719, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/e15/18514228_1866356270294794_3081850854077104128_n.jpg", "video_views": 3, "caption": "Kenneth was hiding inside an egg looking chair for kids , he thought he was a \ud83d\udc25 hatching.\ud83d\ude02", "comments": {"count": 1}, "likes": {"count": 2}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516758364489807706", "dimensions": {"height": 750, "width": 750}, "owner": {"id": "2280295167"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/18512452_127450457819471_3986077427074859008_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMm7JFhHda", "date": 1495031708, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s750x750/sh0.08/e35/18512452_127450457819471_3986077427074859008_n.jpg", "caption": "Proper #shelter provides a foundation on which #families can begin to look beyond the poverty barriers that hold them back \n#WednesdayWisdom #HabitatIndia #housing #HousingForAll", "comments": {"count": 0}, "likes": {"count": 4}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516757426023752519", "dimensions": {"height": 1080, "width": 1080}, "owner": {"id": "1916104281"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/18444971_161197144415594_8895524706271100928_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMmtfElONH", "date": 1495031596, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18444971_161197144415594_8895524706271100928_n.jpg", "caption": "The Army spouses and family.
