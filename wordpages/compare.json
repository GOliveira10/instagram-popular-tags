The people on tv will change with the style, Jesus will NEVER CHANGE! \nAlthough.. it is hard when you see some pretty face with their hair done cute, makeup on point etc. and inside you feel this prick... a prick in your heart (from satan none the less) that says \"hey, you should be like her, all the guys like her, and she is better than you,  you're nothing compared to her\" .. but God says \"No, be different, be like ME!\" This life as a Christian is NOT about us, it's all about Jesus! And telling other's about Jesus and how to be saved!  We need to strive to BE LIKE JESUS! Not the people you see on tv... Ask God to mold you into what He wants! \nYou won't regret it! \nAnd also... when you get dressed ask yourself \"Will this cause someone (a man) to stumble, will it cause a woman to look down at her toes and feel that prick?  Maybe some women don't think like that.. but it's definitely an area I need to work on (comparison).. who's with me?

This creates a deep feeling of discontent in people, which I believe is the root cause of much of the unhappiness people are experiencing today. \nBecoming consciously aware that what we see on social media is not the \"full story\" can be a good first step to remove that discontent\u270c\ud83c\udffd", "comments": {"count": 20}, "likes": {"count": 456}}, {"id": "1516644996470853353", "dimensions": {"height": 247, "width": 320}, "owner": {"id": "1781667799"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/c54.0.366.366/18513341_362437590821141_7350914725573558272_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMNJa5BM7p", "date": 1495018194, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e35/18513341_362437590821141_7350914725573558272_n.jpg", "caption": "Like when you get it\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\n#photoftheday #photofday #ayeshatakia #sonamkapoor #sonam ##compare #boobs #mountain #flat #nothing #huge #troll #like #followmenow #followmeplease #follow #pleasefollow #f4l #ultimate_bakchodi", "comments": {"count": 1}, "likes": {"count": 145}}, {"id": "1516411566491341479", "dimensions": {"height": 1080, "width": 1080}, "owner": {"id": "322832369"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/18512396_420556954997447_2553615678200348672_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BULYEkSApKn", "date": 1494990367, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18512396_420556954997447_2553615678200348672_n.jpg", "caption": "Reminiscing through old pictures, thought I'd compare. #old #picture #compare #applesandoranges #applestooranges #lildicky #whycantfruitbecompared #thatsongsdope #okayillstop #lol #tricking #planzero", "comments": {"count": 17}, "likes": {"count": 148}}, {"id": "1516456932302233071", "dimensions": {"height": 750, "width": 750}, "owner": {"id": "1596596368"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/18445075_1467546809993223_4547880057292455936_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BULiYufDZ3v", "date": 1494995775, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s750x750/sh0.08/e35/18445075_1467546809993223_4547880057292455936_n.jpg", "caption": "Here is a little comparison of my hair length.\nThe picture above left shows my hair length in the middle 2011. I started growing them long again in 2010 when I had shoulder length hair (I didn't found a good photo of this).\nThe picture down left shows my hair length in the end of 2014. At that point I found the LHN (a longhair forum) and I found a length I wanted to reach. Before this I just thought of something like I had back in 2007 before I cutted them (It was around hip length). Now in May of 2017 (picture on the right) I reached that length goal I had: Classic length with 107cm according to SSS.\nBut already some month ago I thought about growing my hair longer than this. I started to dream about how I would look and feel with knee length hair. Now I am on my journey to find this out. \ud83d\ude04\n\nOne thing I have to mention in this moment.\nMy hair taught me a lot in this years, specially in the last one.\nFirst of all to be patient. Growing hair long needs time. I know this and yeah I am still unpatient sometimes and don't want to wait for something. But I can see some things relexed, because I got to know that they are not able from now to the next moment.\nSecond to be happy about baby steps. I was frustrated a lot of times, because I wanted something and I felt like I never going to reach it, that I am not good enough. I didn't saw a progress or soemthing like this. Most times I just didn't saw that progress, but it was there. I just didn't noticed the small steps I was doing. Now I know that I have to look closer and that this baby steps are okay for me, this is the time I need for the progress. When I would force me to bigger steps it would just make me unhappy and feeling bad, so I guess I can be happy about every baby step I am doing. Hopefully constant like my hair is growing around 1cm in one month. It brings me further to my goal.\nThe third point is to never give up even it is hard. When I want to reach it I have to try it. When I fall down I have to stand up again. And when I have to do this thousend of times. When I real want to do soemthing than it worth it. Just like my hair never gives up in growing long even I cutted it. It tries it again and again.", "comments": {"count": 23}, "likes": {"count": 102}}, {"id": "1514041955054312641", "dimensions": {"height": 809, "width": 1080}, "owner": {"id": "1465018163"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/c135.0.809.809/18443323_456932477984595_5778828181226127360_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUC9SLqDNzB", "date": 1494707887, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18443323_456932477984595_5778828181226127360_n.jpg", "caption": "Some amazing stuff by @jasonlaboyphotography no photoshop or green screen used.
