It hurts to look back at the memories. It hurts to write all about it all, but It just can't seems to stop. All I can think about is how much i cared, how much i loved you and how you threw it all away;not One,not twice but several times. All i ever asked for was honesty and consistency. And you failed to even do that. You failed to be the person I knew you could be. You settled for what you had and I guess that's okay. But you lost out on so much, to help you,grow and succeed. Maybe you were afraid. Maybe you didn't knew what you wanted. But you can't do rest of the life, unable to decide what you want or who you want in your life. Decisions have got to be made. Something has got to give and maybe in time, I'll forget you,if that's what's made to happen. Maybe I'll lead the life I've always wanted to, the only exception is it being without you.\nI'll have the strength to carry on as I have had all along.\nI'll forget the memories which have become so dear to me.\nAnd I'll forget you,surely.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#beautifullypainful #poetry #poetrycommunity #spilledink#poetsofinstagram #poet #poetrylovers#poetryofinstagram #poetsofig #igpoets #mirakee#poemsofinstagram #poems #poemsporn#creativewriting #love #bymepoetry#writersofinstagram #writers #livebywords#writerscommunity #writersofig #writingcommunity#writer #wordporn #passion #willyoureadittome#wordswithkings #writers", "comments": {"count": 0}, "likes": {"count": 6}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516765351579571094", "dimensions": {"height": 360, "width": 640}, "owner": {"id": "3166284448"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e15/c140.0.360.360/18444679_644804159045807_3809141971528712192_n.jpg", "is_video": true, "code": "BUMog0UhVOW", "date": 1495032541, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e15/18444679_644804159045807_3809141971528712192_n.jpg", "video_views": 0, "caption": "#\u043f\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043a #prank #pranks #singer #dancer #coach #teacher #actor #actress #reporter #writer #player #gamer #beauties #model #topmodel #star #superstar #racer #\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c #\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c #\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440 #\u0431\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 #\u0431\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u043e #\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0440 #\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0430 #\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 #\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b #instadance #haha", "comments": {"count": 0}, "likes": {"count": 0}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516765344189867225", "dimensions": {"height": 1080, "width": 1080}, "owner": {"id": "1541444399"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/18514259_223579571475395_3429790771815907328_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMogtcD2TZ", "date": 1495032540, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18514259_223579571475395_3429790771815907328_n.jpg", "caption": "And maybe there is something more loving waiting for you than what you have lost..!\n___________________________\n@words.ae \n#word #\u0639\u0631\u0628 #\u062d\u0628 #\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646 #\u062f\u0628\u064a #\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629 #\u062d\u0632\u0646 #\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633_\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u064a\u0626\u0647 #\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0644\u0627\u0644 #lebanese #arab #europe #arab #arabic #writer #writing #poetry #poet #art #artist #\u0641\u0646 #picoftheday #bestoftheday  #photooftheday #instagood #instadaily #followforfollow #white #black #girl", "comments": {"count": 0}, "likes": {"count": 1}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516765244775607935", "dimensions": {"height": 640, "width": 640}, "owner": {"id": "4452903433"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18444949_1473406472727002_1925074289904582656_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMofQ2gi5_", "date": 1495032528, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18444949_1473406472727002_1925074289904582656_n.jpg", "caption": "words on fire\n.\n.\n.\n#rinakingpoems #poet #poetry #instapoet #poetsofig #igpoets #poetsofinstagram #poems #poetsociety #poetrygram #poetrycommunity #writer #writing #instawriter #writersofig #writersofinstagram #writingcommunity #instaquote #quotes #quotestoliveby #girlswhowrite #girlswhoread #love #romance #heartbreak", "comments": {"count": 0}, "likes": {"count": 2}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516765209828797511", "dimensions": {"height": 1350, "width": 1080}, "owner": {"id": "339784618"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/18513007_1280243478757686_3073484657216454656_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMoewThCxH", "date": 1495032524, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18513007_1280243478757686_3073484657216454656_n.jpg", "caption": "A new section.

But every now and then, she'd catch herself reflecting on how perfectly the universe pieced together the chapters of her life. Sure, it has thrown her curveballs and obstacles. It has beaten her up and taken things from her and broken her heart. But honestly, it has also always shown her why. Always. And those are the times she loves-- when all the pieces she's been living finally fit together and form the big picture. The one that makes sense. The one that shows why each and every thing that happened had to happen exactly that way. In precisely that time. And there have been more than a few times that she's seen the universe work a little magic. She hadn't know it at the time. But there had been times in her life she'd thought were perfectly on track. She had what she thought she wanted-- and everything she thought she'd needed. Things had structure and purpose and she was clear and focused. And then, out of the blue, it would happen. Things would swirl into chaos. Things she thought were there for a lifetime would dance away from her. Things would get dark and scary and uncertain. And she'd question why. Always why. She'd think everything was wrong and her life was off track and she'd have twinges of doubt. But then it would happen. The eye of the hurricane-- the temporary calm in the midst of the storm. And she'd know. Even more than those chaotic times having a purpose-- even more than it all being a part of her big picture-- those times were a blessing. A blessing. She knew she'd never understand it at the time. But she also knew the universe had incredible power and forsight. And every now and then, it swooped in and used its power to save her. Save her-- before she even knew she needed saving. And it would all make sense one day. So until then, she was going to trust it. All of it. Every day is just one more piece of the puzzle. \ud83d\udc9b // May 2017 Theme: Call Me #unstoppable ----------------------------------------------------- #liveinthedetails #writerscommunity #writersofinstagram #poetsofig #poetrycommunity #poetry #poetryisnotdead #poetsofinstagram #writersofig #writer #soul", "comments": {"count": 16}, "likes": {"count": 1755}}, {"id": "1516753142993396518", "dimensions": {"height": 1080, "width": 1080}, "owner": {"id": "4544706078"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/18444396_832472943595942_5223668564040351744_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMlvKMFCMm", "date": 1495031086, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18444396_832472943595942_5223668564040351744_n.jpg", "caption": "Don't stop your journey no matter what just make it look beautiful because that's what ppl love to see a beautiful journey.... #zanzibar #Tanzania... #daressalaam #africa #blogger #travelbloggers #bloggers #blog #wildlife #photography #bazilpatel #traveldiaries #travel #wildlife #southafrica #travelgoals #gypsy #flyingbird #hippie #instago #travelgrams #nomad #adventure #dark #photogram #photographer #swag #masai #writer #writersofig #dubai", "comments": {"count": 7}, "likes": {"count": 4234}}, {"id": "1515302065969911559", "dimensions": {"height": 800, "width": 640}, "owner": {"id": "1109329475"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e15/c0.80.640.640/18512418_1838525383075863_5828684346281689088_n.jpg", "is_video": true, "code": "BUHbzNZjVcH", "date": 1494858104, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e15/18512418_1838525383075863_5828684346281689088_n.jpg", "video_views": 4009, "caption": "Sometimes you want to go back and #live your best moments again.
