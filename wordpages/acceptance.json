It still surprises me how difficult I find it to listen to my body. Even after all the lessons I've learned and all I've been through. \nI'm 17 years into life with ME/CFS now, it's been at different levels of severity throughout those years (my story is over on my blog for any of you who want to read it). Some years severe to the point of being unable to sit up/care for myself, other years have been much better to the point of believing I was almost recovered. \nDuring the last couple of years, things have been tough, and generally all over the place, due to various infections and then other factors including a thyroid condition and endocrine system issues complicating things and setting me back. \nAt the moment I am really struggling with getting real about where I am actually at and pace myself in the way that my body desperately needs me to. It can be so disorientating living inside a body that doesn't match up to the energy and life that you feel is in your soul. \nThere's still this determined part of me, the part with such a passion for life, that kind of thinks 'ah I'll be okay' and try to push through, but as any of you with this condition will know, its not as simple as that! \nI had three days where I went out this week despite my symptoms rapidly increasing. By yesterday my body was literally screaming at me, and by last night I could barely move. You know that level of unbearable crushing fatigue where you feel like your body is shutting down? \nToday, is about getting real about where I am at in my journey. Not trying to forcefully change that. Aiming for some level of peace with that. Letting myself cry when I need to. Drinking lemon and ginger tea and listening to the rain outside whilst resting under a blanket on my sofa. \nOn days like this all we can do is rest, be kind ourselves and find comfort in the little things. \n_________________________\n#lessons #mecfs #cfs #autoimmune #thyroid #adrenals #chronicillness #toughdays #honest #candle #rain #peace #acceptance #healing #blogger #hbloggers", "comments": {"count": 0}, "likes": {"count": 5}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516759875647273594", "dimensions": {"height": 1080, "width": 1080}, "owner": {"id": "1300067"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/18579834_448193675530914_605227794711969792_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMnRIdhXp6", "date": 1495031888, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18579834_448193675530914_605227794711969792_n.jpg", "caption": "Life is a journey. \u26f5\ud83d\udc95 How do you feel on the ride?\n\nMany times we live as though the destination and speed were everything there was to life.

rolls of skin whenever I sat down. When I was younger I hated how large my breasts were, how they weighed me down and changed my posture, and the way they stretched my skin. I would look at myself in the mirror and tell myself how ugly my smile was, I despised the way my teeth protruded outward, the gaps between my teeth and that they didn't align up perfectly straight. I hated that I didn't have the same features as my friends, and I hated that in the eyes of society, I was ugly. I felt ugly. I told myself I was ugly all the time, for a long time. I tried everything I could to change what I was and how I looked. I wanted to be anything other than myself. Our culture has conditioned us to believe that we have to maintain our bodies in a certain manner to be accepted, to be beautiful, and even to be loved. It's all a load of shit. How I look, or how my body is shaped does not define the amount of love that I deserve. \ud83d\udc51 ...Read the rest of this blog on body acceptance at riseofthewoman.com #riseofthewoman #bodyacceptance", "comments": {"count": 22}, "likes": {"count": 362}}, {"id": "1516352692044356964", "dimensions": {"height": 1080, "width": 1080}, "owner": {"id": "4519628966"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/18444780_1568094139869015_7726984480077905920_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BULKr1Lgt1k", "date": 1494983348, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18444780_1568094139869015_7726984480077905920_n.jpg", "caption": "Okay so, I decided to take a step out of my comfort zone and smile wITH TEETH AARGHh. \nThose of you who don't know, I'm self conscious about my teeth and my smile- I took quite a few photos to actually pick two that looked 'normal' and 'nice' because I'm scared of what others would think. \nAlthough, it is just a smile. :') \ud83d\udc9c\nI'm proud of myself for actually doing this.
