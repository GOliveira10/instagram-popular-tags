It is a melting pot and meeting point for fish farmers, businessmen and women dealing in fish and products such as feeds, drugs. \nThe market takes care of the various demands of buyers in terms of variety of the products and type of fish desired;whether it is live catfish or smoked ones, buyers are always presented with different choices from which to select.  The market is organised into five segments: those trading in smoked fish, those trading in fresh fish, those selling frozen fish, those who serve as dealers and receive the fish directly from farmers and suppliers, those whose business is preparing the fish for buyers and those selling fish feeds and drugs. \nvisit our website www.smallafricanbusinessnetwork.com for full market stories and and entrepreneurs \n#marketwednesdays #market #transportation #transfer #buyers #sellers # people #supplies #sellers #buy #money #negotiate #negotiations #promote #promoting #fact #Nigeria #supply #state #abuja #marketers #located #fish #kado#sunny #sabn #largest #second", "comments": {"count": 0}, "likes": {"count": 6}}], "count": 138622, "page_info": {"has_next_page": true, "end_cursor": "J0HWRxglgAAAF0HWRxQEAAAAFiYA"}}, "top_posts": {"nodes": [{"id": "1516423163456581319", "dimensions": {"height": 1350, "width": 1080}, "owner": {"id": "310558140"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080/18513566_102101803707608_812780998369476608_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BULatUzAO7H", "date": 1494991749, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18513566_102101803707608_812780998369476608_n.jpg", "caption": "#wear this #dress to #work #coworkers #said #where r u #going ??? #back to #your #school #\ud83d\ude1c To the #bank #banker #asked do you want to #open a #student #account #\ud83e\udd23To #buy #beer the #sellers asked is it your #real #id\nSometimes i #forget #my #age \n#\ud83d\ude18 #like4like #followme", "comments": {"count": 2}, "likes": {"count": 763}}, {"id": "1516688170421667659", "dimensions": {"height": 1324, "width": 1080}, "owner": {"id": "1488555265"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/c0.122.1080.1080/18579808_101209337130413_1683023788666519552_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMW9rxBUdL", "date": 1495023340, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18579808_101209337130413_1683023788666519552_n.jpg", "caption": "Oil painting 65x91 cm Lady with hat #contemporary #birds #revolve #explosions #collage #artists #oil #drawing #collectors #seller #acrylic #contemporaryartist #oil #art #illustration #prints #collectors #sellers #contemporaryart #artistsofig #flame #dome #dealer #fashion #work #artists#gallery#london\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7", "comments": {"count": 1}, "likes": {"count": 258}}, {"id": "1516696079562581099", "dimensions": {"height": 400, "width": 640}, "owner": {"id": "3174192126"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e15/c135.0.450.450/18512314_1751206928503131_5448334953219620864_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMYwxujiRr", "date": 1495024283, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/e15/18512314_1751206928503131_5448334953219620864_n.jpg", "caption": "What makes a house \"Fur Baby \" friendly?
