Approximately 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners from across the globe gathered in New York to take part in a number of events to #celebrate this major milestone. A grand parade was held in #Manhattan on May 12.\n\nThe parade started from Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Plaza near the United Nations #headquarters, marched through midtown-Manhattan, passed by Grand Central Terminal and Bryant Park, and terminated at the #Chinese #General #Consulate. The parade started at 9:30 a.m. and last for four hours. The route was about two miles in length.\n\nLeading the #parade was one of three Tian Guo Marching Bands, followed by a #dragon #dance team comprised of New York-based practitioners. Behind them were practitioners carrying colorful banners, followed by motorized floats on which practitioners demonstrated the exercises, and #golden costume-clad practitioners beating #traditional tunes on red waist #drums.\n\nNew York Police Officer: Everyone Should Have Falun Dafa!\n\nThree #police #officers on duty received hand-made lotus flowers from Falun Gong practitioners. Seeing the #delightful parade, they shouted, \u201cFalun Dafa is good!\u201d along with other spectators. Officer Anthony said, \u201cVery good! Very nice! Everyone should have Falun Dafa!\u201d Writer: The World Needs Such People :\n\nWriter Erla was born in #Norway and now makes her home in New York. She watched the parade with her friend Teder. Erla said that she very much enjoyed the #music #accompanying the parade. She added that it was great to see so many people from different #countries taking part. She admired the practitioners' perseverance in striving to live by Dafa's principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance, and added that she wished that leaders of all countries would follow the principle.\n\nErla said she knew about the #persecution of Falun Gong in #China, and she felt it incredible that such a thing could occur nowadays.

Then, the #soldiers and police #molested them and robbed whatever they found on the women's bodies such as gold and money. They took away any gold and money, whatever valuables that they found. They destroyed food, household and kitchen wears, according to the villagers.\n\nAgain on May 8th, 2017 a group of border guard police from Taung Bazar regional camp and Kyaung Taung village and another group of soldiers from Light #Infantry Unit 552 and 232 collaborated together and entered into Middle hamlet and Sar Kine hamlet of Kyaung Taung village tract.\n\nOnce the troops entered, and as the villagers already experienced the attacks on May 6th, all men and two thirds of the women escaped from the village immediately. The troops robbed from every house and destroyed whatever they couldn't carry with them. According to the villagers, they raped many women and girls till May 11th, 2017.\n\nThe villagers said border guard police officers Ko Ko Oo and Maung Maung Htay specifically, have #raped many women and girls.
