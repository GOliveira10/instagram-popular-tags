(2011-2015).\n\u2796\nThe maps are based on figures for 2011-2015, published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). They exclude weapons trade deals below $100 million. The total volume of arms sales for this period was higher than for any other five-year stretch since the end of the Cold war, in the early 1990s.\n\u2796\nThe United States not only has the world's largest defence budget by far (1), it also outsells all other countries by a considerable margin. For the aforementioned period, American weapons exports were worth $46.4 billion, almost a third of the global total (32.8%). Russia\u2019s amounted to $35,4 billion, representing just over a quarter of the global arms trade (25.3%). The margin between both is more than what numbers three and four each earn on their arms trading: France made $8,1 billion, while China raked in $7,9 billion.\n\u2796\nEach of the four maps mentions the five major recipients of that country's arms exports \u2013 providing a peek into each exporter\u2019s geopolitical priorities. As for America, they seem to be in the Middle East, mainly. The five biggest buyers of U.S. military hardware were, in descending order: Saudi Arabia ($4.6 billion), the United Arab Emirates ($4.2 billion), Turkey ($3.1 billion), South Korea ($3.1 billion) and Australia ($2.9 billion). In all, America sold more than $100 million worth of arms to 42 countries, many of them also in the Middle East.\n\u2796\nRussia and India have the single-biggest bilateral arms trade relationship in the world, at least for the period described here. From 2011 up to and including 2015, New Delhi bought for $13.4 billion in arms from the Russians. And despite being a major exporter itself, even China acquired a lot of Russian weaponry, to the tune of $3.8 billion. Vietnam stocked up on Russian arms for almost the same amount ($3.7 billion). Other large recipients of Russian weapons were Algeria ($2.6 billion) and Venezuela ($1.9 billion).\n\u2796\n#map #maps #cartography #geography #topography #mapping #mappe #carte #mapa #karta #europe #cities #city #latitude #replaced #northamerica #european #capitals #capital #comparison #comp", "comments": {"count": 0}, "likes": {"count": 6}}, {"comments_disabled": false, "id": "1516759182303602478", "dimensions": {"height": 640, "width": 640}, "owner": {"id": "347751599"}, "thumbnail_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18444670_445104095870066_3858011754395074560_n.jpg", "is_video": false, "code": "BUMnHCvBKcu", "date": 1495031806, "display_src": "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/18444670_445104095870066_3858011754395074560_n.jpg", "caption": "Day 44/100: How does inequality affect happiness?

A person who considers themselves into health and fitness eats sweets - and is openly talking about it on social media.) \ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udf1d\ud83c\udf1d\u2800\n\u2800\nYou see, although I\u2019m fully aware that a handful of almonds contains lots of wonderful nutrients that would keep me fuller for longer, some days (no matter whether I\u2019m looking to gain, maintain or lose weight) I\u2019ll choose to eat sweets or a chocolate bar as a snack \ud83d\udcaa\u2800\n\u2800\nWhy? Because when the majority of my diet has consisted of well-balanced food that\u2019s full of micronutrients, I have no issue eating something thats less so just because I love the taste of it. This is just a personal choice. Cutting out things I love isn\u2019t realistic for me so I always squeeze something sweet into my days (all whilst still sticking to my calorie/macro/micro targets.)\u2800\n\u2800\nMany would choose the almonds for the nutritional value or the flavour - which is totally fine. Many would choose the almonds because even though they'd prefer Fruit Pastels, almonds would make them feel more \u2018on track\u2019 mentally - which again, is totally fine \ud83d\udc95\u2800\n\u2800\nI\u2019m not glorifying sweets, or almonds for that matter. I\u2019m glorifying knowing what\u2019s in the food you\u2019re eating, and make educated decisions based on your own values. And I value food that\u2019s good for my body and good for my soul.\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2018Healthy' to me is exactly what I make it.

I spent my entire adult life in a body I didn't feel comfortable in. And as the years went by, I was more self conscious. Hiding from pictures, hiding in baggy clothes.\nThe picture on the left was taken the summer of 2007. 10 years ago. I wasn't at my biggest, because I remember wearing size 18 pants. I couldn't tell you what I weighed. I was 22 years old.\nFast forward to today. I still have my flaws that I get bothered by. I'm not where I want to be, but I am so far from where I once was. I have a confidence in myself that I've never experienced in my life. And this goes beyond just looking good. Confidence as a whole in life. Not questioning myself, not afraid to go after what I want. Today, at 32, I'm healthier than I've ever been.. physically + mentally. I'm a constant work in progress. We all are. The amazing thing is every day we are given a new chance to progress, to go after the things we want in life. Don't let it pass you by.
