It did not seem odd in that moment, but Jack refused to rise and hug her. No one thought about that until later, much later when it was too late. Almost too late. That Jack refused to rise and embrace his daughter.\rAs she climbed the stairs, The Medicine Man spoke to her from the landing. It was dark there and his black overcoat and wide-brimmed hat played in different shades of darkness and shadow.\r\u201cNow I\u2019ll lay thee down to sleep,\u201d he said.  Reese went up the stairs, almost happy he was here. She was happy he would help her sleep when he injected her. \u201cPray to me, you\u2019re soul I\u2019ll keep,\u201d The Medicine Man\rcontinued. \nShe got to the landing, turned to the left and took the final six stairs, almost two at a time.\r\u201cYou won\u2019t die before you wake.

Constantius died in July the following year in York.\n\nThe system of succession at the time demanded that another Caesar should become emperor but the soldiers in York immediately proclaimed Constantine their leader.  It proved to be a pivotal moment in history.  He is known as Constantine the Great for very good reasons.\n\nAfter nearly 80 years, and three generations of political fragmentation, Constantine united the whole of the Roman Empire under one ruler.  By 324 he had extended his power and was sole emperor, restoring stability and security to the Roman world.

Can you spot this copy at San Diego Zoo this afternoon? \nAbout the book:\n\nLife of Pi is a Canadian adventure novel by Yann Martel published in 2001. The protagonist is Piscine Molitor \"Pi\" Patel, an Indian boy from Pondicherry who explores issues of spirituality and practicality from an early age. He survives 227 days after a shipwreck while stranded on a lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.\n\nAbout the location:\n\nThe San Diego Zoo is a zoo in Balboa Park, San Diego, California, housing over 3,700 animals of more than 650 species and subspecies. Its parent organization, San Diego Zoo Global, is one of the largest zoological membership associations in the world, with more than 250,000 member households and 130,000 child memberships, representing more than a half million people. The San Diego Zoo was a pioneer in the concept of open-air, cageless exhibits that re-create natural animal habitats. It is one of the few zoos in the world that houses and successfully breeds the giant panda. In 2013, the zoo added a new Koalafornia Adventure exhibit, providing an updated Australian animal experience. 2017 will see the opening of Africa Rocks.\n\nThanks to book fairy Lisa for leaving this gift and sending us a pic on twitter!
